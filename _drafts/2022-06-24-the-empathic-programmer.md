# The Empathic Programmer: Impostors, Fearless Coders and Leaders

On my first day at Red Hat, the lights at the office were all off, there was no one waiting at the reception,
and when I left my team mates for goodbye, they said "see you next Thursday." 

I wasn't ready for working from home. I never thought twice about that before. I am lucky enough to live in a big city,
so commuting is not a problem for me. At my previous employer I went to the office every day. I had wonderful
work mates. As a kid I was kind of a loner. I fought hard to become less shy: staying home, alone felt like a step back.
So, at some point, I swore to myself that I would go to the new office every day.

Never would I have imagined that, just a couple of years later, I would have found myself forced at home. Well, nobody would.

## Forced At Home ##

You would know by now that Italy was the first country in Europe to be striken by the pandemic. At first we would
joke about it; then came the news and a wave of global uncertainty. Luckily Red Hat is a remote-first company; 
I myself was allocated to a project that was on the verge of hitting its first big release deadline. 
So I just thought "oh ok; might as well pour myself into this work." I am sure I am not alone. Big mistake: 
I ended spreading myself too thin and burned out.

On the other hand, I do think I have learned a thing of two from this experience, and these are my notes.

## Impostors ##

Although the Red Hat offices were among the first that locked down, people continued working from home.
In fact, there were new hires being onboarded. Some of them never even had a chance to set foot in the office.
Some of them had never worked from home before.

As a new hire, we have all been there, you are starting from square one. Your mates are already acquainted 
with their code base and the work environment. You feel like you have to show that you deserve to be there.

Now, I don't like the term *impostor syndrome*. While I do believe that spreading awareness is important,
I also believe that *there is nothing wrong with feeling like an impostor*. It means you are not "the smartest person 
in the room". It means that you can learn a lot from your team mates. "The impostor syndrome" is a misnomer;
it frames that feeling as something destructive; but you can reframe it as something *constructive*. 
Rather thank thinking what your team mates know that you don't, think of everything you can actually *contribute*. 
And I mean *everything*: your experience is broader than writing code. 

Now, on the other hand, if people *makes you feel like an impostor*, then that's an entirely different problem.
That is a toxic workplace and you should leave that job or at the very least that team.

## People Who Are Not Afraid To Code ##

Now, imagine it being your first days on the job: you know nobody, you know nothing and you are alone,
locked down in your home and you want to prove that you deserve to be on that team.

What would you do? We are developers, we write code for a leaving; so we tend to believe that writing code
is the thing we do best. So, when we are panicking we reach out for the thing that comes off the easier. 
We want to show that we are right for the job, we want to show there *is* indeed something we can
contribute. And that thing is *code*. And the codebase is new and alien, so we don't know much about it,
and struggle to get anything done. 

Then suddenly inspiration strikes you and we write code for the best of a few days. Indeed,
there are still things we do not understand, but somehow we made it; it works, we are ready to submit 
our changes.

But our workmates reject them.

## Extending Empathy ##

You know how that saying goes: code is "like violence, if it doesn't solve solve your problem you're 
not using enough".

You have panicked and your knee-jerk reaction was retiring in your cave, furiously writing code for 
a week. Your pride and shyness prevented you from asking enough help to your mates: what if
they discover you are not good enough?

But you know how to code "and you are not afraid to do it". At last, you proudly emerge 
back with 10.000 lines of code. Your team mates complain about your change being unreviewable.
You feel even more of an impostor.

What went wrong?

Well, first of all, you asked yourself what you can contribute to the team, 
and reached for the easiest answer: code. Second, you were so worried about asking for help,
that you ended up doing a lot of useless work.

But the good news is that it is not all on you: have your workmate ever checked on you
while you were struggling alone in your dark cave?

## Empathy and Leadership ##

- How to make people comfortable.
- overcommunicate
- bad vs good code: it is a spectrum
- a good design when it is a good fit for your team, not when it is the best possible design
- being a good leader means taking tough decision (good OSS projects have a BDFL)
