# The Empathic Programmer: Fearless Coders, Impostors and Leaders

On my first day at Red Hat, the lights at the office were all off, there was no one waiting at the reception,
and when I left my team mates for goodbye, they said "see you next Thursday." 

Well, that was weird. My previous office was at walking distance from the new place,
but the difference felt like day and night. Shiny everlit open spaces in a skyscraper. But that would 
not matter much for a Red Hatter, because they worked from home. To be fair I never 
even considered that an option. I am lucky enough to live in the big city, so commuting is not much of a problem for me. 
Besides, I always thought of the office as of a place where making new friends. After all,
you spend most of your week together with your workmates. So, at some point, I swore to myself that 
I would go to the new office every day. All in all, I found a good balance, and I met most team mates
at least once a week.

Now, you probably already know that Italy was the first country in Europe to be striken by the pandemic. 
I think the experience was trying for all of us. I, myself, I do think I have learned a thing or two;
these are my notes.

## People Who Are Not Afraid To Code ##

Although the Red Hat offices were among the first that locked down, people continued working from home.
In fact, there were new hires being onboarded. Some of them never even had a chance to set foot in the office.
Some of them had never worked from home before.

When the pandemic hit, I myself was allocated on a project that was on the verge of hitting its 
first big release deadline. So I just thought "oh ok; might as well pour myself into this work." 
Well, spoiler alert: that was a huge mistake; I ended up spreading myself too thin and burned out.

Now, in those days, I was curating different aspects of the project. In many cases I got frustrated. 
I concluded that most frustration was due to a lack of empathy from either side.

For instance, when I was reviewing some of the latest contributions to that codebase, 
I had the impression they did not put a lot of a lot of thought into that work. 
In fact, I had the impression that, rather than *thinking*, someone would just *write code*. 
And then they would run into some issue, so they would just throw more code at it. 
Yes, it felt like they thought that code is "like violence": "if it doesn't work
you're just not using enough". I called them "People-Who-Are-Not-Afraid-To-Code™️", because they knew
how to code and... they were not afraid to do it. 

You would think that these people act out of disrespect; that they do not care about others, 
and would rather dump on you a few thousands line of code rather than taking the time to do proper planning.

In other cases, I had major arguments about some technical issue. We strongly argued against each other's 
point of view, and, beacuse they were very vocal, I took it as a lack of manners. To the point I thought they 
were acting in bad faith.


## Cultural Diversity ##

You would think that another major source of frustration would be working in a truly
distributed team. On the one hand, because of the different time zones, sometimes touching bases 
with other team members was challenging. On the other hand, I was forced at home. The team mates
I usually met weekly at the office felt just as distant as anybody else. In a way, being forced at home
zeroed our geographical distance and put everyone at the same level. 

In practice, I discovered an incredible degree of affinity with team mates at the other side of the globe:
it truly made me appreciate the global dimension of Red Hat as a company. I became friends
with people that I hardly spoke to in the past; and in some sense, I have to thank the pandemic for that.

Because I could not meet with my usual friends in person, and I could not attend conferences,
the pandemic made me appreciate how easily I could connect with people living in distant 
places on the planet, who would share with me their experiences, so that, at least, I could travel with my imagination. 

I also understood how isolated they would feel when some decision had been taken at our local offices,
without taking them into account; and, by extent, it made me also appreciate how a similar feeling
of detachment and exclusion would be felt by other remote workers; in other words, "FOMO": the Fear-Of-Missing-Out.


## Impostors ##

I have personally grown to dislike the term *impostor syndrome*. In fact, I kind of believe that 
*there is nothing wrong with feeling like an impostor*. It means you are not "the smartest person in the room". 
It means that you can learn a lot. As [Alicia Liu puts it in her short essay][no-impostor]:

> My concern with this misrepresentation of Impostor Syndrome is that it pathologizes 
> the very process of learning itself. When you’re learning, you’re supposed to feel 
> like you’re in the deep end and over your head, otherwise, you’re probably not learning very much. 
> Use that feeling to push yourself to learn more and get better.

I understood that many of those "People-Who-Are-Not-Afraid-To-Code™️" that I would scoff at, were really
trying to prove themselves worthy. Some of them were in their first days on the job. Now, imagine:
you know nobody, you know nothing and you are alone, locked down in your home, and you want to prove 
that you deserve to be on that team. So, you panic.

What would you do? We are developers, we write code for a living; so we tend to believe that writing code
is the thing we do best. So, when we are panicking we reach out for the thing that comes off the easier. 
We want to show that we are right for the job, we want to show there *is* indeed something we can
contribute. And that thing is *code*. And the codebase is new and alien, so we don't know much about it,
and struggle to get anything done. 

Then suddenly inspiration strikes us and we write code for the best of a few days. Indeed,
there are still things we do not understand, but somehow we made it; it works, we are ready to submit 
our changes.

And then maybe our workmates reject them.

What went wrong?

Well, first of all, you asked yourself what you could contribute to the team, and the only answer
you found was "code". Second, you were so worried about asking for help, that you ended up doing a lot of useless work.

This feeling of "being an impostor" may fade with time, but it may never fade out completely; the error is thinking
this is bad: this is *good*! Rather than thinking about what your team mates know that you don't, 
think of *everything* you can actually *contribute*. Be it ideas, be it attitude. 

I myself, I like to do high-level design and academic research just as much as I like to write code. 
But my issue is that I may get caught in a form of [analysis paralysis][analysis-paralysis].
Now, what *I* can bring to the team, is my love for design and research; but what the *fearless coder* brings is the
the burning desire to build something for real!

So you can see how everyone, even in a highly-diverse team may bring their own contribution.
On the other hand, if people make you *feel* like an *impostor*, then that's an entirely different problem.
That is a toxic workplace and you should leave that job or at the very least that team.


## Extending Empathy ##

In fact, *fearless coders* are not helpless. When they retire to their cave, as a workmate,
you should not ignore them. You should *check* on them.

A severe misconception of remote work is that, because you "work from home", it is your
prerogative to be a misanthropic antisocial. Well, let me be blunt: I am sorry but, no, 
that just makes of you an asshole.

If anything, remote working requires of you to be way *more* empathic. I am using the word "empathy"
here with kind of a broad meaning. It is definitely about being *kind* to each other; it is also
about trying to be receptive of the *feelings* of your mates; but it is also about
understanding the *technical needs* of your mates.

In an office environment, your workmates can literally *see* when you are struggling. 
You would swear, you would curse; or maybe you are silent, with a look of dread in your eyes.
People would see those signs, they may reach for you and tell "can I help you?".
And soon you learn that you are surrounded by people that can lend you 
a hand when you are in trouble.

But this simple, effortless interaction, that is natural in an office, becomes intentional
and proactive: you are no longer able to just tap on someone's shoulders; 
you have to stop what you are doing, send them a message, wait for their answer. 

Do not mistake productiveness and effectiveness for "uninterrupted flow". Do not fear to ask.
If you got caught in a loop, you may only get out of it by talking to someone. In fact,
an effective remote worker may have to interrupt *way more frequently*, than if they sat
side-by-side to another team mate.

But at the same time, if you love going to the office, then *more power to you!* But you can be 
an asshole too. If you have remote workmates that can't or won't come to the office, they should
not feel as second-class.

Your role, as a team leader, is to make people comfortable: be them remote workers 
or office workers, they're all team mates. Write documents, be transparent, involve them
in relevant decisions.

## Technical Empathy ##

What about the *technical needs*, though? The effectiveness of a team is not only measured
by the skills of their members. Modern development is a social activity. 

I don't believe in the fable of the mythical [*10x engineer*][10x-engineer], 
the legendary creature who is supposedly worth alone the value of 10 other developers.
These modern titans would hold up the entirety of a codebase on their shoulders; making
them a major risk if they decided they want to leave.

A great team is a team where every member has an opportunity to express their talent: this
may require compromise. There are *excellent* technological choices that are, however, only 
within the reach of a handful of chosen ones: the *10x engineers* that would leave when they get bored.    
There are *bad* choices, that a *fearless coder* may have spewed out in a moment of panic.

Your role as a team leader is to pick neither choice: neither the *bad one* because 
"we are on a rush, and we need to deliver", neither the *excellent one* because "purity goes
above everything else". It is a spectrum: you have to pick the choice that is a good fit 
for your team, even if they are not the best.

Your role, as a leader, is also to make tough choices: do not fear to take an impopular
choice, because you may no longer be liked. Good open source projects have a Benevolent 
Dictator For Life! 

## Conclusions ##

When I joined Red Hat, the culture shock was intense. Not because I was working with people from
different countries; in fact, at the beginning I tended to work with people from my same country.
But because I struggled to understand their point of view. I think the pandemic had a profound impact
on the way many of us see interactions in the workplace. Today, I go way less to the office.
In the future, who knows? Regardless your preference, I hope that tomorrow,
when you sit at your desk, be it at home or at the office, you'll make that extra effort
and to really be an *empathic programmer*.
