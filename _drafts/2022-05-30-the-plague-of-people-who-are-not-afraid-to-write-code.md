"When the man with a book meets the man with the keyboard, 
the man with a book will be crushed dead under the weight of a ten thousand commits" (ancient proverb)



It is sometimes said that good developers should be [*lazy and dumb*][lazy-and-dumb]. I think it originated from another saying, that the three great virtues of a programmer are [*lazyness, impatience, hubris*][laziness-impatience-hubris].

Regardless its origin, it seems widely regarded that a common habit of a good developer is to minimize useless work. In fact, I would argue that, in this sense, *lazyness*  should be intended as that mixture of wonder and dread and anxiety that keeps my hands off the keyboard: do I really *know* the solution? Should I rather investigate more?

In all fairness, my personal issue is that I tend to get stuck in that state of [*analysis paralysis*][analysis-paralysis] because I want the solution to be *perfect*.

In fact, there is always a tension between looking for the best possible answer, and timing and schedules. Sometimes it is just unfeasible to take a lot of time to reflect; when timing is essential, it is ok to just "do it". But I always try to keep on the back of my mind (or, rather, on a ticket) that I should get back to it, and see if there are better solutions. 

On the other hand, lazyness seems to be alien to the mythical [*10x engineer*][10x-engineer], that legendary creature who is supposedly worth alone the value of 10 other developers.

It is unclear whether the *10x engineer* is really found in nature: a modern titan over whose shoulders stands the entirety of a complex software system; maybe the reason is because people have been looking  in the wrong place: putting the fate of your whole business in the hands of one single engineer sounds hellish to me. 

Or maybe, like it happens for many other mythical creatures, the *10x engineer* really is just a real animal that some people, from a distant view have mistaken for magic. I personally have often come across  beasts that are way less fictitious and that I like to call  "People Who Are Not Afraid To Write Code".
