San Biagio was just a few days ago, but if that really bothers you, you can mentally replace all references to Panettone with Tortelli alla crema e chiacchiere di Carnevale.
The festive season is that period of the year when they tempt you to indulge in those dear sweet, sugary treats.
Personally, as an Italian, I do love me some panettone.</description></item><item><title>Write You A Chat For Great Good!

Welcome back to &amp;ldquo;Learn You An Actor (System) For Great Good!&amp;rdquo;. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the first part, jump there to learn how to write a minimalistic actor runtime using Java 17.
As promised, in this second part I am showing how to write a tiny chat client/server using the runtime we wrote. Then, we will run it using JBang! Next time, we will learn how to create a typed version of the same actor runtime and revisit the examples!</description></item><item><title>Learn You An Actor (System) For Great Good!

about 20 lines of code; a few years later, a revised version showed how to do the same in Scala.
I think untyped actors in the style of Akka Classic have always felt clunky in Java; Java used to lack a way to express pattern matching concisely. However, a few days ago I realized that Java 17 provides enough syntactic sugar to write shorter actors:</description></item></channel></rss>
