You may have started to wonder whether this technology is something you should care about.
In this blog post, we will lightheartedly explore the history of Wasm. I will not make any claim about correctness: I may have made mistakes; in that case, feel free to contact me! I will try to motivate how we came to defining the WebAssembly standard and VM, and how they are all about providing a multi-platform, portable low-level compilation target for multiple programming languages.</description></item><item><title>Kogito: A Modular Codegen Design Proposal</title><link>/posts/2020/04/23/kogito-a-modular-codegen-design-proposal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2020/04/23/kogito-a-modular-codegen-design-proposal/</guid><description>My favorite topic of discussion last year was moving computations to compile-time.
In fact, I went to a few conferences explaining how moving processing out of your run-time and into build-time, is a conceptually simple but extremely effective way to make your applications lighter. This was sometimes received with little enthusiasm: the idea itself is in fact far from new. Yet, it is key to a lot of the most interesting recent innovations in the Java ecosystem.</description></item></channel></rss>
