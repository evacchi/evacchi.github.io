The name “Shapeless” comes from a famous Bruce Lee quote:
Don&amp;rsquo;t get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water. Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot.</description></item></channel></rss>
