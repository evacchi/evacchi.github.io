In fact, I went to a few conferences explaining how moving processing out of your run-time and into build-time, is a conceptually simple but extremely effective way to make your applications lighter. This was sometimes received with little enthusiasm: the idea itself is in fact far from new. Yet, it is key to a lot of the most interesting recent innovations in the Java ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Quarking Drools</title><link>/posts/2019/03/15/quarking-drools/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2019/03/15/quarking-drools/</guid><description>The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim. (Edsger W. Dijkstra)
Motivation ðŸ”—Rule-based artificial intelligence (AI) is often overlooked, possibly because people think itâ€™s only useful in heavyweight enterprise software products. However, thatâ€™s not necessarily true. Simply put, a rule engine is just a piece of software that allows you to separate domain and business-specific constraint from the main application flow.</description></item></channel></rss>
