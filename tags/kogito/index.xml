&lt;p>In fact, I went to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TWfigR9wGsA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUrY6On1SxM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conferences&lt;/a> explaining how &lt;strong>moving processing out of your run-time and into build-time&lt;/strong>, is a &lt;strong>conceptually simple&lt;/strong> but &lt;strong>extremely effective way&lt;/strong> to make your applications lighter. This was sometimes received with &lt;strong>little enthusiasm&lt;/strong>: the idea itself is in fact far from new. Yet, it is key to a lot of the most interesting recent innovations in the Java ecosystem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quarking Drools</title><link>/posts/2019/03/15/quarking-drools/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2019/03/15/quarking-drools/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting

&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation &lt;a href="#motivation" class="anchor">ðŸ”—&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Rule-based artificial intelligence (AI) is often overlooked, possibly because people think itâ€™s only useful in heavyweight enterprise software products. However, thatâ€™s not necessarily true. Simply put, a rule engine is just a piece of software that allows you to separate domain and business-specific constraint from the main application flow. We are part of the team developing and maintaining Droolsâ€”the worldâ€™s most popular open source rule engine and part of Red Hatâ€”and, in this article, we will describe how we are changing Drools to make it part of the cloud and serverless revolution.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
