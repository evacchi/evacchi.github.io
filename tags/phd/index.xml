journal; there I drew the conclusions about the year that was coming to
an end. It was a simpler time, when &lt;em&gt;journals&lt;/em&gt; were not &lt;em&gt;peer-reviewed&lt;/em&gt;,
and when &lt;em&gt;conclusions&lt;/em&gt; were drawn without an extensive comparison with
the state-of-the-art. Just thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I did not. I was too involved with the final touches on this
dissertation. And a terrible fever. But mostly, the dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
