&lt;p&gt;The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting
than the question of whether a submarine can swim. (&lt;em&gt;Edsger W.

&lt;h2 id="motivation"&gt;Motivation &lt;a href="#motivation" class="anchor"&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rule-based artificial intelligence (AI) is often overlooked, possibly because people think itâ€™s only useful in heavyweight enterprise software products. However, thatâ€™s not necessarily true. Simply put, a rule engine is just a piece of software that allows you to separate domain and business-specific constraint from the main application flow. We are part of the team developing and maintaining Droolsâ€”the worldâ€™s most popular open source rule engine and part of Red Hatâ€”and, in this article, we will describe how we are changing Drools to make it part of the cloud and serverless revolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
