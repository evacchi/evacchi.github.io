In the past, people have given a lot of crap to the JavaScript ecosystem, but if there is something I envy, is how tiny some libraries are. People are still joking about &lt;a href="https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left-pad&lt;/a> to this day; in reality, the JavaScript ecosystem has come a long way ever since, and I believe we have all something to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Long story short, I was looking for a Java library to parse &lt;a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebAssembly binaries&lt;/a>, and what I found was either a full-blown interpreter or something outdated. Then I remembered about &lt;a href="https://kaitai.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaitai Struct&lt;/a>, a parser generator for binary structures that supports a number of languages. I have read great things, but I never had a reason to try it personally; until &lt;em>now&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
