# About Me


During my PhD I researched language design and implementation at [University of Milan](https://www.di.unimi.it). After three years at [UniCredit Bank's R&D department](https://unicredit.eu), I have joined Red Hat in the [KIE group](https://www.kie.org), where I worked on the [Drools rules engine](https://drools.org) and the [Kogito project](https://kogito.kie.org). I moved to [Tetrate](https://tetrate.io), as a core maintainer of [wazero](https://wazero.io), the pure-Go Wasm Runtime; at [Dylibso](https://dylibso.com) I still contributed to [wazero](https://wazero.io), while also working on [Chicory](https://chicory.dev/), a pure-Java Wasm Runtime, and [Extism](https://extism.org/), the polyglot Wasm-based plug-in system.

I have now returned to Red Hat as a member of the AI Engineering team!
